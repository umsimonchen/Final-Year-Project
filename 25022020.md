### Discussion: 
Since we have succeeded in building the expected fundamental components of our application. The next stage is to embed them in the interface. Therefore, we focused on the designs and the reports which should be efficient, friendly and attractive to the users. In addition to the pie chart for different groups of students in different grades and the bar chart for the distribution of different choices, we think it should be involved with a chart that compares a student's score with others or the previous ones. We need to make full use of every data we have and consider which graph would be more useful for reflection standing on themselves rather than making waste. Besides, word cloud is also a task for our project. There are some existed plugin components to take charge of such function. However, we still need to work on it for practicability. For example, we should consider how to detect the students' answers and separate them correctly(for phrases) and correct the wrong spelling word to right one to display(for words). For question on whether a course could open multiple quizzes, we ruminated and drew a conclusion that a teacher taking a course probably would get tired of opening multiple quizzes for the same course. It would be efficient to open just one and collect their answer for references. 

### Challenges: 
The challenges we face is how to cooperate with each other among the team since now we could not contact face to face. Each team member's alteration on the application would affect other ones' work. We are use Github and Bitbucket to share our work and we now spend more and more time on merging our work after we push them on the code base. Besides, we need to consider how to apply the function on view page, which is not only about the normal running of those function but also the user interface design as well. Everyone is necessary in this procedure. 

### Schedule:
After the first meeting, we are going to keep going for a more profound application. We need give at least a basic word cloud and more fresh interfaces next time. At the meanwhile, we still need to improve the inlay of functional components.

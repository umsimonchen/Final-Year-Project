### Discussion: 
In this meeting, we showed the latest version on quiz attending component, which is more user-friendly and functional. At first, we allow teacher to have advance settings on opened quiz. Duration is the time offered for student to take. It is represented as the minute by an integer larger than 0, since we do not allow a too short or invalid time. Start time and end time is still under construction since we think it is not suitable for in-class exercise to have a time limit. But it would probably be helpful when a teacher sets a start/end time in case he forgets and causes a delay. If time permits, we would realize it. Then, we forbid teachers to open multiple quiz at the same time for the same reason. And teachers need to close the existed one before open new one in case sudden shutoff on student quiz taking pages. Besides, we have discussed the format in student taking quiz page. There should be enough indication to guide the students correctly input their answers. Students need to finish all questions before submission, except the quiz is submitted by the system when time is up. Since we suppose multiple choices could have one or more correct answer, we could not reuse the same pattern in true or false questions, which are only allowed to be chosen either one answer. Otherwise, it makes no sense and might make influence on our system.

### Challenges: 
The biggest challenges are facing the is how to deal with the real-time update while the quiz is open or close. If it is done, as soon as the teachers open or close quiz, student could get the notification on the preview page and quiz taking page. Otherwise, student need to refresh page every time to see the latest information. Besides, if we make decision to apply start time and end time to opened quiz, we must think about how we can do a timed quiz open in our system. 

### Schedule:
After a series of effort on the system by each member, nowadays we have a rudiment of our expected system. Teacher can create quiz, open quiz for students and review the performance of them. On the other hand, students can take the quiz and get the feedback as well. Though some advanced functions are still in development, basically it can be run in some way. Therefore, we are going to finish them all and give out a demo during next meeting.

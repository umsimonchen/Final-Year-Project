### Discussion: 
This is the first meeting of new semester after the lunar Chinese New Year. Since the plague was rampant all over the world, we decided to take the meeting through cyber chatroom. First of all, we concluded and summarized what we have done and what we need to do in the future, which could reinforce our knowledge and adjust the objectives appropriately because the resource is limit at these times. We decided to finish as many functions, especially the fundamental ones such as teachers create quizzes and courses, students take and submit their answers of quizzes and grading. In addition, we also talk about how to make a user-friendly interface specially for students¡¯ perspective. On one hand, a detailed and straight forward report of specified quiz taken is necessary, which means we need make full use of the charts and graphs for presentations. On the other hand, we still need to work hard on the word cloud that is efficient and appreciable during the on-class open discussion. 

### Challenges: 
The challenges we face is how to connect each department in the application together so that it would be easily for us to transfer and manipulate the data properly. Since Ruby on Rails has a high level of convention, which as saying goes: Convention is over configuration. Everything we try to do need to follow the procedures designed by its bedrock. Besides, if we want a compelling interface, it has to employed certain JavaScript coding that impulses the interaction between front end and back end.

### Schedule:
After the first meeting after the holiday, we are awakened for a new stage of tasks and challenges. At presence we need to finish as many components as possible and try to make the interface more friendly. Donald and Simon would focus on teacher and student part respectively on Ruby on Rails mechanism construction more, while Carman and Chloe would sculpture the interface and embedded the Ruby on Rails codes into views.

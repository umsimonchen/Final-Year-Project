### Attendees: 
Simon, Donald, Carman, Chloe

### Finished items (from the last meeting notes): 
the outline

### Discussion: 
In the first meeting, we were basically talking about the outline of our final year project. For example, at the beginning, we talked about the basic functions and extra functions. Since our project is about a student-teacher learning interaction system, called Macas, we will have two main parts: the student perspective, teacher perspective and feedback. In the student perspective, we suppose students can join in and answer the quizzes given by the teacher and discuss with teacher through the system. In the teacher perspective, first of all, the teacher can create the quizzes, which might consist of multiply choice, true or false, short answer or even matching and drawing questions. Both of the question and answer need to be allowed to upload the media resource such as image, video and audio. Secondly, it can import or export files like quizzes or grades. Thirdly, as an optional function, it can also be used to take attendance as well. In the feedback aspect, we design to use chart with pie or bar to display the feedback from the studentsâ€™ answer. And, for deeper, we would try working out the word cloud as a new method for presentation. 
 
### Challenges: 
The challenges we face at first is on how to distribute our group into properly sizes since here we have three different aspects but we have only four people divided into two group. After talking with our supervisor, we are suggested to put one sub-group in teacher perspective and the other sub-group in student perspective and feedback. But we still work together in practice because they are closely related and hard to be separated.  

### Schedule:
After the first meeting, we have the basic idea what we need to do and what we are going to do next. Then, the next task we need to complete is the database of the whole system, which would be one of the most important phase in the whole final year project.

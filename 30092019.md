### Attendees: 
Simon, Donald, Carman, Chloe

### Finished items (from the last meeting notes): 
basic relations of database

### Discussion: 
In the first meeting, we were basically talking about the relations of the database. First of all, we would have a table called quiz, which contains the id, name, create date, owner (teacher’s id) and the total number of question. One quiz would have many question, and each question might be multiply-choice, true or false or short question. So we create a template called question that contains the basic attributes of question and then respectively create three different kinds of table for better record the coordinate answer. Option table contains each option in the question, especially MC and T/F. In short question, we try combining all the suggested answer together with colon. If we want to examine student answer, we just need to find whether it match anyone of them. To publish the quiz, we suppose to make a course, some kind like a platform, to do it. Considering the quiz can be on-class or off-class, it has start-time, end-time to represent the available time and duration to limit the answer time. Teacher and student are used to record the user information. Within student perspective, we have student result record the overall information of the quiz while student answer to record each independent question answer. Finally, we have a media table for storage and extraction. For detailed information, please see the image attached.  
 
### Challenges: 
The challenges we face at first is the question part. Since we separate the question into three kinds, which may be a little bit heavy and reductant, we are suggested to leave it away and directly make a relation between question and option.  There is also a way that use assigned id, for example, MC is 1xxxxxx, TF is 2xxxxxx, SQ is 3xxxxxx, to estimate complex searching. Secondly, we need to consider about the anonymous problem for some open-end quiz. But if we don’t use student id to identify each one it would probably be hard to distinguish the result. We temporarily decided to add an attribute sign to tell whether it is for anonymous. If is, then the system generates random unique number to replace the student id. And if the student has attended a real-name quiz, it is forced to log-out before he attends an anonymous quiz.

### Schedule:
After the first meeting, we have a basic plan of the database. Next, we are going to continuously improve the database and consider how to implement it in computer, either server or cloud.
